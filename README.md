# EF Core EDMX Power Tools

A simple CLI tool to generate an EF Core context and related entities from an exitsing EDMX file.

This repo has been unforked and renamed from https://github.com/ErikEJ/EFCorePowerTools to live on its own, stealing some of the original bits in the process. Thanks @ErikEJ.

TODO List:

[ ] Solution cleanup to retain only the CLI tool and related projects.
